##### Using git clone (Recommended)

Simply use the git clone command 
```bash
linux> git clone https://github.com/DLTX-DEVANSH/Notes_Root
```

now you will have a folder named `Notes_Root` where you would have cloned the repo 
`Open Obsidian -> goto manage valuts button at the bottom left -> Open folder as vault -> browse -> select the  folder-> done :)`

###### Why git clone ? 

whenever I would update my notes , you can simply use 
```bash
linux> git pull origin 
```
to sync with the latest updated version of notes without re-downloading it all again

##### You can also do 
**Download This repositroy and unzip it**

Open Obsidian -> goto manage valuts button at the bottom left -> Open folder as vault -> browse -> select the unziped folder 
			  -> done :)

***Everything is linked in the notes so just open*** `Index.md` ***and you should be able to traverse trough entire notes folder through internal links , just like a website***
